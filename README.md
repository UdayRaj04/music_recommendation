# Music Recommendation System based on User Facial Emotions or Expressions:
## Project Overview:
Develop a web-based platform that recommends music based on a user's facial emotions or expressions. The system will also allow users to select a song name or singer name manually. Based on the detected emotion, the system will automatically search and play relevant music from YouTube.
## 1.User Interaction:
Users can either input a specific song name or singer name.
The system also captures real-time facial expressions using the user's webcam.
## 2.Emotion Detection:
Utilize facial recognition and emotion detection algorithms to analyze the user's current mood (e.g., happy, sad, angry, relaxed).
Integrate a machine learning model trained to detect emotions from facial features.
## 3.Music Recommendation:
Based on the detected emotion, recommend a list of songs that match the user's mood.
Create a mapping between different emotions and music genres or song types (e.g., happy -> upbeat pop, sad -> soft ballads).
## 4.YouTube Integration:
Use the YouTube API to search and retrieve music videos that match the user's mood and/or selected song/singer.
Automatically play the recommended or searched music video directly on the website.
## 5.User Options:
Allow users to override the systemâ€™s recommendation and search for a specific song or artist.
Provide options to save favorite songs or playlists based on different moods.

# Challenges:
Accurate emotion detection in varying lighting and environmental conditions.
